We have done few simple calculations for checking whether the energy 
change when forcing the unit cell dimensions to some specific substrates (GaAs, InP)
is small enough.

For the bulk **(a=408pm, c=656pm)** ferrimagnetic state, which we've previously found to be most energy
efficient, the unit cell energy is:
**-35203.71313413 Ry**

When moving to GaAs **a=399pm** and assuming constant unit cell volume, we get **c=684pm**. At that point 
the energy is:
**-35203.71112331 Ry (+0.0020 Ry)**

When moving to InP **a=415pm** and assuming constant unit cell volume, we get **c=634pm**. At that point
the energy is:
**-35203.70633369 Ry (+0.0047 Ry)**

We believe that these energy changes could be small rnough to support thin-film growth of Mn2Sb on these substrates.

Next step would be to optimise the unit cell dimensions in respect to energy when these substrates are used and the energy change should be recalculated.
